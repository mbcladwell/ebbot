[{"id":0, "title":"Propaganda", "author":"Edward Bernays", "field4":"", "field5":"", "content":"Indeed, as they (citizens) learned more and more about the outright lies, exaggerations and half-truths used on them by their own governments, both populations came, understandably, to see “propaganda” as a weapon even more perfidious than they had thought when they had not perceived themselves as its real target."},
{"id":1, "title":"Propaganda", "author":"Edward Bernays", "field4":"", "field5":"", "content":"The world informed by “public relations” will be but “a smoothly functioning society,” where all of us are guided imperceptibly throughout our lives by a benign elite of rational manipulators."},
{"id":2, "title":"Propaganda", "author":"Edward Bernays", "field4":"", "field5":"", "content":"Lippmann had arrived at the bleak view that “the democratic El Dorado” is impossible in modern mass society, whose members—by and large incapable of lucid thought or clear perception, driven by herd instincts and mere prejudice, and frequently disoriented by external stimuli—were not equipped to make decisions or engage in rational discourse. “Democracy” therefore requires a supra-governmental body of detached professionals to sift the data, think things through, and keep the national enterprise from blowing up or crashing to a halt. Although mankind surely can be taught to think, that educative process will be long and slow. In the meantime, the major issues must be framed, the crucial choices made, by “the responsible administrator.” “It is on the men inside, working under conditions that are sound, that the daily administration of society must rest.”"},
{"id":3, "title":"Propaganda", "author":"Edward Bernays", "field4":"", "field5":"", "content":"“We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.” These “invisible governors” are a heroic elite, who coolly keep it all together, thereby “organizing chaos,” as God did in the Beginning."},
{"id":4, "title":"Propaganda", "author":"Edward Bernays", "field4":"", "field5":"", "content":"It is a sort of managerial aristocracy that quietly determines what we buy and how we vote and what we deem as good or bad. “They govern us,” the author writes, “by their qualities of natural leadership, their ability to supply needed ideas and by their key position in the social structure.”"},
{"id":5, "title":"Propaganda", "author":"Edward Bernays", "field4":"", "field5":"", "content":"Propaganda is an expensive game that is played best by those who have the most to spend on it."},
{"id":6, "title":"Propaganda", "author":"Edward Bernays", "field4":"", "field5":"", "content":"Propaganda's goal is to transform the buyer’s very world, so that the product must appear to be desirable as if without the prod of salesmanship."},
{"id":7, "title":"Propaganda", "author":"Edward Bernays", "field4":"", "field5":"", "content":" Conscious and intelligent manipulation, invisible governors, they who pull the wires which control the public mind, shrewd persons operating behind the scenes, dictators exercising great power, and, below them, people working as if actuated by the touch of a button."},
{"id":8, "title":"Propaganda", "author":"Edward Bernays", "field4":"", "field5":"", "content":"...for in their universe the truth is ultimately what the client wants the world to think is true."},
{"id":9, "title":"Propaganda", "author":"Edward Bernays", "field4":"", "field5":"", "content":"As with the risks of smoking, so it has been, until very recently, with global warming, and so it is today with the carcinogenicity of cell phones, and the toxic side effects of fluoride, just to name a few underreported threats to public health. In all such cases, the investigative journalist is the propagandist’s natural enemy, as the former serves the public interest, while the latter tends to work against it."},
